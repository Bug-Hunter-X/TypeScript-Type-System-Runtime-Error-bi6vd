This repository demonstrates a common issue in TypeScript where type errors don't always lead to compile-time failures. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers and return their sum, but the code calls it with a string and a number.  While TypeScript allows this, it results in a runtime concatenation instead of an addition, leading to unexpected results. The solution involves using type guards or more robust input validation to prevent such issues.
